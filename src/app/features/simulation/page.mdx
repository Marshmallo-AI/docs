# Simulation

Simulation replays the same task with different models or settings. It helps you compare outcomes without changing production traffic.

## What You Can Do
- Re-run a trace with a new model
- Compare outputs side-by-side
- Measure reward changes across model choices

Simulation uses existing traces, so you can evaluate changes without new data collection.
