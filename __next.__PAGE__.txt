# Introduction

Marlo is the learning layer for agent runs. You keep your agent code and infrastructure. Marlo records what the agent did, scores the outcome, and turns that result into guidance the agent can use later.

## What Marlo Does
Marlo adds a feedback loop on top of your existing agent:
- **Capture** the full timeline of model calls, tool calls, and outputs.
- **Score** each task with a clear rationale.
- **Learn** from the result and store it as guidance.
- **Apply** active learnings to future runs.

## Why It Matters
In production, failures are hard to debug because the evidence is scattered across logs, prompts, and tool outputs. Marlo gives you a single, consistent record of what happened so you can grade outcomes and improve reliably.

## What You Send
Marlo needs a small, stable set of data for every task:
- Agent definition (system prompt, tools, MCP, model config)
- Task input and output
- LLM calls and tool calls
- Task status

The SDK handles the plumbing and keeps telemetry best-effort so your agent never breaks if Marlo is down.0:{"buildId":"H9-sMxe8ismC63N9K0vnQ","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mx-auto x:flex x:max-w-(--nextra-content-width)","children":["$","$L2",null,{"value":[{"value":"What Marlo Does","id":"what-marlo-does","depth":2},{"value":"Why It Matters","id":"why-it-matters","depth":2},{"value":"What You Send","id":"what-you-send","depth":2}],"children":[["$","$L3",null,{}],["$","$L4",null,{"metadata":{"sidebar_position":1,"slug":"/","title":"Introduction","filePath":"src/app/page.mdx","timestamp":1768256099000},"sourceCode":"$5","children":[["$","div",null,{"id":"nextra-skip-nav"}],["$","main",null,{"data-pagefind-body":true,"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"x:tracking-tight x:text-slate-900 x:dark:text-slate-100 x:font-bold x:mt-2 x:text-4xl","children":["Introduction","$undefined"]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"x:not-first:mt-[1.25em] x:leading-7","children":"Marlo is the learning layer for agent runs.
