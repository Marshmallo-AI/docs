# Learnings

Learnings are reusable guidance generated from past task outcomes. They capture what works and what to avoid, so your agent improves automatically over time.

## Why Learnings Matter

Agents make the same mistakes repeatedly because they have no memory of past failures. Each task starts fresh, with no knowledge of what went wrong before.

Learnings solve this by extracting patterns from rewards and turning them into actionable guidance. When your agent fails a task, Marlo generates a learning that describes what to do differently. The next time a similar task runs, that learning is injected into the agent's context, helping it avoid the same mistake.

This creates a continuous improvement loop: failures become lessons, and lessons prevent future failures.

## How Learnings Work

Learnings are generated automatically after a task receives a reward:

1. **Reward Analysis**: Marlo examines the reward rationale to understand what went wrong or what could be improved.

2. **Learning Generation**: A model extracts actionable guidance from the rationale, describing what the agent should do in similar situations.

3. **Confidence Assignment**: Each learning receives a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating how reliable the guidance is based on supporting evidence.

4. **Storage**: The learning is stored and associated with the agent that produced it.

5. **Application**: When a new task starts, active learnings for that agent are fetched and can be injected into the agent's context.

## What a Learning Contains

Each learning includes:

- **Learning**: The guidance itself, written as a clear instruction (e.g., "Always verify order ID format before calling lookup_order").
- **Expected Outcome**: What improvement this learning should produce (e.g., "Reduces tool call failures").
- **Confidence**: A score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how reliable this learning is.

## Fetching Learnings

Use `task.get_learnings()` to fetch active learnings for the current agent:

```python
with marlo.task(thread_id="user-123", agent="support-agent") as task:
    task.input(user_message)

    # Fetch learnings
    learnings = task.get_learnings()

    # Build system prompt with learnings
    system_prompt = "You are a customer support agent."
    if learnings:
        learnings_text = learnings.get("learnings_text", "")
        if learnings_text:
            system_prompt += f"\n\nLearnings from past interactions:\n{learnings_text}"

    # Use system_prompt in your LLM call...
```

The `learnings_text` field contains a formatted string of all active learnings, ready to inject into your agent's prompt. You decide where to place it: in the system prompt, as a separate context block, or anywhere else that makes sense for your agent.

## How Learnings Evolve

Learnings are not static. As more tasks run and more rewards are generated, Marlo updates existing learnings with new evidence:

- **Confidence Increases**: When a learning is applied and the task succeeds, the confidence score increases.
- **Confidence Decreases**: When a learning is applied and the task still fails, the confidence score decreases.
- **Refinement**: If new evidence suggests a learning should be modified, Marlo updates the guidance while preserving the learning ID.
- **Retirement**: Learnings with very low confidence are eventually retired and no longer surfaced.

## Per-Agent Learnings

Learnings are scoped to individual agents. Each agent has its own set of learnings based on its own task history. In multi-agent systems, the orchestrator, researcher, and writer each develop their own learnings independently.

This means specialized agents get specialized guidance. A researcher agent learns how to search effectively, while a writer agent learns how to structure summaries clearly.0:{"buildId":"C37_ARqDSqvv8ElxtPMXO","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mx-auto x:flex x:max-w-(--nextra-content-width)","children":["$","$L2",null,{"value":[{"value":"Why Learnings Matter","id":"why-learnings-matter","depth":2},{"value":"How Learnings Work","id":"how-learnings-work","depth":2},{"value":"What a Learning Contains","id":"what-a-learning-contains","depth":2},{"value":"Fetching Learnings","id":"fetching-learnings","depth":2},{"value":"How Learnings Evolve","id":"how-learnings-evolve","depth":2},{"value":"Per-Agent Learnings","id":"per-agent-learnings","depth":2}],"children":[["$","$L3",null,{}],["$","$L4",null,{"metadata":{"sidebar_position":3,"title":"Learnings","filePath":"src/app/features/learning/page.mdx","timestamp":1768507550000},"sourceCode":"$5","children":["$L6","$L7"]}]]}]}],null,"$L8"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
