# Graph

A graph system is a flexible workflow where agents can connect in many directions, not just in a straight line. You define the connections between agents explicitly, and the system can include branches, merges, and feedback loops.

## How to Track It
Use `task.child()` for each node execution. Store edge or routing info in task metadata if you need explicit graph structure.
