# Orchestrator

An orchestrator system has one root agent that coordinates the task and delegates work to several specialized agents. The root agent decides which sub‑agent to call, collects their outputs, and produces the final response.

## How to Track It
Use `task.child()` for each delegated agent run. The SDK links child traces to the parent automatically.
