# Learning

Learning turns reward rationales into stable, reusable guidance for the agent.
The goal is simple: **reduce failures and keep decisions consistent**.

## Inputs To Learning
Learning runs after rewards. It uses:
- task reward output (score + rationale + principles)
- task trajectory context (same task the judge saw)
- agent definition (system prompt and tools)

Learning never runs on guesses. It only uses what was actually captured.

## What A Learning Is
Each learning is stored as a small, structured rule:

- **cue**: what to detect in the task or context
- **action**: what the agent should do
- **expected effect**: why this helps

This format makes learnings easy to apply and to measure.

## Shadow vs Active
Learnings start in **shadow**:
- they are tracked
- they are not injected into the prompt

When a learning proves useful over time, it moves to **active**:
- it is injected into the prompt
- its adoption and outcomes are tracked

If it harms performance, it can be demoted back to shadow.

## How We Know A Learning Works
Marlo tracks adoption and outcomes:
- did the agent follow the learning?
- did reward scores improve?
- did failures drop?

If adoption is low or outcomes degrade, the learning is removed or demoted.

## Where Learnings Live
Learnings are stored per agent (using `learning_key`, usually the `agent_id`).
That means each agent has its own learning set.

In multi‑agent systems, each agent has separate learnings.

## How Learnings Are Used
The SDK returns learnings as text.
You inject them into your system prompt.

Example:
```python
learnings_text = marlo.get_learnings_text()

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""
You are a support agent.

Learnings:
{learnings_text}
"""
```

If you do not inject learnings, they exist but they do not affect the agent.
