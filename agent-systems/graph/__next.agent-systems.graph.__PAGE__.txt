# Graph

A graph system is a flexible workflow where agents can connect in many directions, not just in a straight line. You define the connections between agents explicitly, and the system can include branches, merges, and feedback loops. This is a supported agentic system in Marlo.

![Graph agent system diagram](/img/graph.png)

How Marlo represents it:
- The system stores the agent list and the explicit edges between agents.
- The trace can show branching, merging, and repeated calls between agents.
- Parent agent ids still exist for each agent run, but the system edges describe the overall map.

What you need to send:
- Agent definitions for every agent in the graph.
- Agent start and agent end events for each agent run.
- Parent agent ids for each agent run.
- The system map (agents and edges) so Marlo can render the full graph.
- Task start and task end events, plus all LLM and tool calls.

Where to wrap and send events:
- Python SDK: `docs/sdk/python`
- HTTP API: `docs/sdk/http`
- TypeScript (HTTP): `docs/sdk/typescript`0:{"buildId":"jlh2X1tjxNDPqLf9oxeRS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mx-auto x:flex x:max-w-(--nextra-content-width)","children":["$","$L2",null,{"value":[],"children":[["$","$L3",null,{}],["$","$L4",null,{"metadata":{"sidebar_position":4,"title":"Graph","filePath":"src/app/agent-systems/graph/page.mdx","timestamp":1767344344000},"sourceCode":"$5","children":[["$","div",null,{"id":"nextra-skip-nav"}],["$","main",null,{"data-pagefind-body":true,"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"x:tracking-tight x:text-slate-900 x:dark:text-slate-100 x:font-bold x:mt-2 x:text-4xl","children":["Graph","$undefined"]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"x:not-first:mt-[1.25em] x:leading-7","children":"A graph system is a flexible workflow where agents can connect in many directions, not just in a straight line.
