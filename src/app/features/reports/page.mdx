# Reports

Reports are the human view of everything Marlo collected.
They show what happened, what changed, and what to fix.

## What Reports Include
Reports summarize:
- task rewards over time
- failure rates
- tool usage and adoption
- active vs shadow learnings
- learning impact windows

Reports are built from the same stored trajectories and rewards.
Nothing is inferred outside the captured data.

## Task‑Level Focus
All reports are task‑level.
This keeps metrics stable even when sessions are long.

You can group by:
- agent id
- time window
- tool name
- learning key

## Why Reports Matter
Reports are how you verify:
- which learnings helped
- which tools caused failures
- which agents are drifting
- when a model change improved or harmed outcomes

## How To Read A Report
Start with:
- overall reward trend
- failure trend
- top active learnings

Then drill into:
- low‑scoring tasks
- tools with high error rate
- learnings with low adoption
