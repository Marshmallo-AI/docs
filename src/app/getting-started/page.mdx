# Getting Started

## Create an account
To get started with Marlo, create an account on our platform.

Click **Get Started**, create your account, then create an organization and a project.

## Create a project
A project represents one agentic system. If you have multiple agentic systems, create one project per system. Each project has its own API key.

## Add your API key
Copy the API key and add it to your `.env`.

## Install the SDK
For Python:
```bash
pip install marlo
```

TypeScript and other languages are coming soon.
