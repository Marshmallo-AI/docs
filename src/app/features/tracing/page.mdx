# Tracing

Tracing is the raw record of what your agent did. Every model call, tool call, and output is captured in order so you can replay the run later.

## What Tracing Captures
For each task, Marlo stores:
- Agent definition
- Task input and output
- LLM calls (messages, model, response, usage)
- Tool calls (name, input, output, error)
- Logs and metadata
- Task status

## Why It Matters
Rewards and learnings are built from traces. Missing events reduce the quality of scoring and the guidance you get back.

## Fail-Safe Behavior
Tracing is best-effort. If Marlo is down, your agent continues running and telemetry is skipped.
