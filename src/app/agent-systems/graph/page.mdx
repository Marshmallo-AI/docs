# Graph

A graph system is a flexible workflow where agents can connect in many directions, not just in a straight line. You define the connections between agents explicitly, and the system can include branches, merges, and feedback loops. This is a supported agentic system in Marlo.

How Marlo represents it:
- The system stores the agent list and the explicit edges between agents.
- The trace can show branching, merging, and repeated calls between agents.
- Parent agent ids still exist for each agent run, but the system edges describe the overall map.

What you need to send:
- Agent definitions for every agent in the graph.
- Agent start and agent end events for each agent run.
- Parent agent ids for each agent run.
- The system map (agents and edges) so Marlo can render the full graph.
- Task start and task end events, plus all LLM and tool calls.

Where to wrap and send events:
- Python SDK: `docs/sdk/python`
- HTTP API: `docs/sdk/http`
- TypeScript (HTTP): `docs/sdk/typescript`
