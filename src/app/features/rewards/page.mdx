# Rewards

Rewards turn a completed task into a score and explanation. They tell you what worked, what failed, and why.

## What Rewards Need
To score a task, Marlo needs a full trace:
- Task input and output
- LLM calls
- Tool calls
- Agent definition

## What You Get
- A numeric score
- A short rationale
- Evidence linked to the exact steps in the trace

Rewards are computed automatically once a task ends.
