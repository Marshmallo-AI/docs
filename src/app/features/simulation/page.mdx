# Simulation

Simulation lets you replay the **same captured trajectory** with different models.
This gives you a clean, apples‑to‑apples comparison.

## What Simulation Uses
Simulation does not generate new tasks. It uses:
- existing task trajectories
- the same tool calls and tool outputs
- the same user messages
- the same agent definitions

Only the model changes.

## Why It Matters
When you compare models on live traffic, the tasks are different.
That makes it hard to know which model is better.

Simulation removes that noise.
You can compare model quality and cost on the exact same data.

## What It Produces
For each candidate model, simulation produces:
- model response
- reward score
- differences vs the original model

This helps you decide which model to promote.

## What It Does Not Do
Simulation does not affect production runs.
It only reads stored trajectories and writes evaluation results.
