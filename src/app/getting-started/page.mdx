# Getting Started

## Create an account

Click **Get Started**, create your account, then set up an organization and a project.

> **Note:**  Marlo is currently in **beta**. For early access, contact us at **hello@marshmallo.ai**.  

## Create a project and get your API key

Follow these steps to create a project and obtain your API key:

1. **Create a project**  
   - Navigate to your dashboard and click **Create Project**.  
   - A project represents a single agentic system. If you have multiple agentic systems, create one project per system.  

2. **Access your API key**  
   - Go to **Settings > Project** for the project you just created.  
   - Copy the API key displayed on this page.  

3. **Add the API key to your environment**  
   - Open your `.env` file in your local project.  
   - Add the following line:  
     ```bash
     MARLO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```  
   - Save the file.  

4. **Install the Python SDK**  
   - In your terminal, run:  
     ```bash
     pip install marlo
     ```  
   - > **Note:** Currently, Marlo supports **Python only**. TypeScript and other language SDKs are coming soon.
