# Co-pilot

Co-pilot is a deep search agent for your traces. It answers questions about what happened, why it happened, and where to look next.

## What You Can Ask
- Which tool calls are causing failures?
- Where do users abandon tasks?
- What changed between two versions of the agent?

Co-pilot reads your traces and returns a short, actionable summary with links to the supporting events.
