# Learnings

Learnings are reusable guidance generated from rewards. They summarize what to do (or avoid) in similar situations.

## How Learnings Work
1) A task completes.
2) A reward grades the outcome.
3) Marlo generates a learning object from the trace and score.
4) Active learnings are surfaced for the next run.

## Using Learnings
The SDK can return learnings as plain text for prompt injection. You decide where to place them in your system prompt or context.
