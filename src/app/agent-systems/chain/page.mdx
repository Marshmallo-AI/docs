# Chain

A chain system is a linear flow where one agent hands off to the next agent. Each agent has exactly one parent, and the work moves in a single direction from the first agent to the last agent. This is a supported agentic system in Marlo.

How Marlo represents it:
- Each agent has its own agent definition.
- Each child agent has a parent agent id that points to the agent that called it.
- The trace shows a clear handoff order from the root agent to the final agent.

What you need to send:
- Agent definitions for every agent in the chain.
- Agent start and agent end events for each agent run.
- Parent agent ids on child agents so the chain can be rebuilt.
- Task start and task end events, plus all LLM and tool calls.

Where to wrap and send events:
- Python SDK: `docs/sdk/python`
- HTTP API: `docs/sdk/http`
- TypeScript (HTTP): `docs/sdk/typescript`
