# Learnings

Learnings are reusable guidance generated from past task outcomes. They capture what works and what to avoid, so your agent improves automatically over time.

## Why Learnings Matter

Agents make the same mistakes repeatedly because they have no memory of past failures. Each task starts fresh, with no knowledge of what went wrong before.

Learnings solve this by extracting patterns from rewards and turning them into actionable guidance. When your agent fails a task, Marlo generates a learning that describes what to do differently. The next time a similar task runs, that learning is injected into the agent's context, helping it avoid the same mistake.

This creates a continuous improvement loop: failures become lessons, and lessons prevent future failures.

## How Learnings Work

Learnings are generated automatically after a task receives a reward:

1. **Reward Analysis**: Marlo examines the reward rationale to understand what went wrong or what could be improved.

2. **Learning Generation**: A model extracts actionable guidance from the rationale, describing what the agent should do in similar situations.

3. **Confidence Assignment**: Each learning receives a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating how reliable the guidance is based on supporting evidence.

4. **Storage**: The learning is stored and associated with the agent that produced it.

5. **Application**: When a new task starts, active learnings for that agent are fetched and can be injected into the agent's context.

## What a Learning Contains

Each learning includes:

- **Learning**: The guidance itself, written as a clear instruction (e.g., "Always verify order ID format before calling lookup_order").
- **Expected Outcome**: What improvement this learning should produce (e.g., "Reduces tool call failures").
- **Confidence**: A score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how reliable this learning is.
- **Basis**: The evidence or reasoning behind the learning.
- **Status**: Whether the learning is active, retired, or pending review.

## Fetching Learnings

Use `task.get_learnings()` to fetch active learnings for the current agent:

```python
with marlo.task(thread_id="user-123", agent="support-agent") as task:
    task.input(user_message)

    # Fetch learnings
    learnings = task.get_learnings()

    # Build system prompt with learnings
    system_prompt = "You are a customer support agent."
    if learnings:
        active = learnings.get("active", [])
        if active:
            learnings_text = "\n".join(
                f"- {obj['learning']}" for obj in active if obj.get("learning")
            )
            if learnings_text:
                system_prompt += f"\n\nLearnings from past interactions:\n{learnings_text}"

    # Use system_prompt in your LLM call...
```

You decide where to place learnings in your agent's context: in the system prompt, as a separate context block, or anywhere else that makes sense for your agent.

## How Learnings Evolve

Learnings are not static. As more tasks run and more rewards are generated, Marlo updates existing learnings with new evidence:

- **Confidence Increases**: When a learning is applied and the task succeeds, the confidence score increases.
- **Confidence Decreases**: When a learning is applied and the task still fails, the confidence score decreases.
- **Refinement**: If new evidence suggests a learning should be modified, Marlo updates the guidance while preserving the learning ID.
- **Retirement**: Learnings with very low confidence are eventually retired and no longer surfaced.

## Managing Learnings in the Dashboard

The dashboard provides tools to view, create, edit, and manage learnings for each agent.

### Viewing Learnings

1. Navigate to your project in the dashboard.
2. Click **Learnings** in the sidebar.
3. Filter by agent to see learnings for a specific agent.
4. Click on a learning to see its full details, including the basis and linked tasks.

### Creating a Learning Manually

Sometimes you know guidance that the system hasn't discovered yet:

1. Click **Create Learning** in the Learnings view.
2. Select the target agent.
3. Enter the learning text (clear, actionable instruction).
4. Enter the expected outcome (what improvement this should produce).
5. Optionally set an initial confidence score.
6. Click **Save**.

Manual learnings are marked as "User Created" and follow the same confidence evolution as auto-generated learnings.

### Editing a Learning

To refine or correct a learning:

1. Click on the learning in the Learnings view.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Update the learning text, expected outcome, or confidence.
4. Add a note explaining the change.
5. Click **Save**.

Edits are tracked in the learning's history.

### Activating and Retiring Learnings

Control which learnings are surfaced to your agent:

1. Click on a learning to open its details.
2. Use the **Status** dropdown to change between:
   - **Active**: Learning is included in `get_learnings()` responses.
   - **Retired**: Learning is no longer surfaced but preserved for history.
   - **Pending**: Learning is under review and not yet surfaced.
3. Click **Save**.

Bulk actions are available for managing multiple learnings at once.

### Reviewing Learning Effectiveness

Track how well learnings are working:

1. Navigate to the **Analytics** section.
2. View success rates for tasks that applied each learning.
3. Identify learnings that consistently improve outcomes.
4. Flag learnings that don't seem to help for manual review.

### Exporting and Importing Learnings

For sharing learnings across projects or backing up:

1. In the Learnings view, click **Export**.
2. Select the learnings to export (or export all).
3. Download as JSON or CSV.

To import:

1. Click **Import** in the Learnings view.
2. Upload your file.
3. Review the learnings before confirming import.
4. Duplicates are detected and skipped.

## Per-Agent Learnings

Learnings are scoped to individual agents. Each agent has its own set of learnings based on its own task history. In multi-agent systems, the orchestrator, researcher, and writer each develop their own learnings independently.

This means specialized agents get specialized guidance. A researcher agent learns how to search effectively, while a writer agent learns how to structure summaries clearly.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Manual Learnings

- **Be specific**: "Verify order ID matches format ORD-XXXXX before calling lookup_order" is better than "Check inputs carefully".
- **Focus on actions**: Describe what the agent should *do*, not what went wrong.
- **Include context**: Mention when the learning applies (e.g., "When handling refund requests...").
- **Keep it concise**: One clear instruction per learning.

### Monitoring Learning Health

- Review learnings monthly to retire outdated guidance.
- Watch for conflicting learnings that might confuse the agent.
- Track confidence scores—learnings stuck at low confidence may need editing.
- Delete duplicate or redundant learnings to keep the context clean.

### Iterating on Learnings

1. Start with auto-generated learnings from low-scoring tasks.
2. Review and refine the generated text for clarity.
3. Test the agent to see if the learning helps.
4. Adjust confidence based on observed results.
5. Retire learnings that no longer apply to your agent's behavior.0:{"P":null,"b":"NnFgBRcy1uWx1YhD4yajq","c":["","features","learning"],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["features",{"children":["learning",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/221ce6682042a4f8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/014d3a509c2c44a0.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/3a4fb10029fc91d1.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-3",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/e0afa020722afb62.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mx-auto x:flex x:max-w-(--nextra-content-width)","children":["$","$L5",null,{"value":[{"value":"Why Learnings Matter","id":"why-learnings-matter","depth":2},{"value":"How Learnings Work","id":"how-learnings-work","depth":2},{"value":"What a Learning Contains","id":"what-a-learning-contains","depth":2},{"value":"Fetching Learnings","id":"fetching-learnings","depth":2},{"value":"How Learnings Evolve","id":"how-learnings-evolve","depth":2},{"value":"Managing Learnings in the Dashboard","id":"managing-learnings-in-the-dashboard","depth":2},{"value":"Viewing Learnings","id":"viewing-learnings","depth":3},{"value":"Creating a Learning Manually","id":"creating-a-learning-manually","depth":3},{"value":"Editing a Learning","id":"editing-a-learning","depth":3},{"value":"Activating and Retiring Learnings","id":"activating-and-retiring-learnings","depth":3},{"value":"Reviewing Learning Effectiveness","id":"reviewing-learning-effectiveness","depth":3},{"value":"Exporting and Importing Learnings","id":"exporting-and-importing-learnings","depth":3},{"value":"Per-Agent Learnings","id":"per-agent-learnings","depth":2},{"value":"Best Practices","id":"best-practices","depth":2},{"value":"Writing Effective Manual Learnings","id":"writing-effective-manual-learnings","depth":3},{"value":"Monitoring Learning Health","id":"monitoring-learning-health","depth":3},{"value":"Iterating on Learnings","id":"iterating-on-learnings","depth":3}],"children":[["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","$L7",null,{"metadata":{"sidebar_position":3,"title":"Learnings","filePath":"src/app/features/learning/page.mdx","timestamp":1769713602000},"bottomContent":"$undefined","sourceCode":"$8","children":["$L9","$La"]}]]}]}],null,"$Lb"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$Lc",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$d",[]],"S":true}
